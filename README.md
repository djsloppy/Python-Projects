**Built with:** Python, SQL<br>
**Features:** databases, SQL, connection to DB.
#### Project 3 - Classes [class_step238.py]
**Overview:** We created a class, then made child classes from that with inheritance. We then were able to initialize those classes and display the data<br>
**Built with:** Python<br>
**Features:** classes (parent/child); inheritance; class methods.
#### Project 4 - Polymorphism - [polymorphism_step246.py]
**Overview:** We created a class, then made child classes from that with inheritance. We then were able to initialize those classes and display the data using polymorphism.<br>
**Built with:** Python<br>
**Features:** classes (parent/child); inheritance; class methods.
#### Project 5 - Student Tracking - [student_tracking.py]
**Overview:** We created a student database front end in Tkinter. It connects to a database to save and and get data to then display.<br>
**Built with:** Python, Tkinter, SQL<br>
**Features:** Tkinter GUI; Database connection; SQL statements.
#### Project 6 - Encapsulation - [encapsulation.py]
**Overview:** Here we learned to work with classes and private and protected variables.<br>
**Built with:** Python<br>
**Features:** Classes; Encapsulation
#### Project 7 - Abstraction - [abstraction.py]
**Overview:** We worked with classes and the Abstractmethod with inheritence.<br>
**Built with:** Python<br>
**Features:** Classes; Abstract method
#### Project 8 - Database Challenge - [database_challenge.py]
**Overview:** With this project we worked with SQL. Connecting to the database, creating the table, inserting data into the table, updating data, and pulling and printing data from the database.<br>
**Built with:** Python, SQL<br>
**Features:** Working with SQL and databases.
#### Project 9 - Date Time Challenge - [datetime_challenge.py]
**Overview:** Using the datetime and pytz modules, I gathered the current time and had it check to see if a branch of a ficticious office was open or closed in their timezone.<br>
**Built with:** Python<br>
**Features:** Time manipulation and calculation.
