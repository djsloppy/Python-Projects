#### Project 1 - Nice or Mean
**Overview:** This game will ask for your name and then based on if you want to be nice or mean will display a phrase and count how many times you were nice or mean.<br>
**Built with:** Python<br>

**Built with:** Python, SQL<br>
**Features:** databases, SQL, connection to DB.
#### Project 3 - Classes
**Overview:** We created a class, then made child classes from that with inheritance. We then were able to initialize those classes and display the data<br>
**Built with:** Python<br>
**Features:** classes (parent/child); inheritance; class methods.
#### Project 4 - Polymorphism
**Overview:** We created a class, then made child classes from that with inheritance. We then were able to initialize those classes and display the data using polymorphism.<br>
**Built with:** Python<br>
**Features:** classes (parent/child); inheritance; class methods.
